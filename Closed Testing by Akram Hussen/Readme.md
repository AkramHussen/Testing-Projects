# Closed Testing for Google Play Apps

This project showcases the workflow used for **closed testing Android apps on Google Play Console**, focusing on release readiness and real user feedback before going public.

---

## Service Overview

I provide a professional closed testing  for Google Play apps.  
The goal is to validate the app with real testers, collect meaningful feedback, and help ensure the app is ready for public release.

## How the Closed Test Is Run

- Set up and manage a closed testing track on Google Play Console.
- Invite and coordinate a group of real testers to install and use the app.
- Monitor usage during the test period and collect feedback on performance, stability, and user experience.
- Highlight issues that should be fixed before enabling the “Production” / public release button.

A typical closed test runs for **about 7–14 days**, depending on the app type and required level of feedback.
